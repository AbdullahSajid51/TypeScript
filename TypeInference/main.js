// Type inference in TypeScript refers to the compiler's ability to automatically determine the type of a variable based on the value it is assigned. This means that you don't always have to explicitly specify the types of variables, parameters, or return values. The TypeScript compiler uses the context in which the variable is used to infer its type.
// Strongly Typed Syntax:
let a = "Pakistan";
let b = 786;
let c = true;
// Type Inference:
let e = "USA";
let f = 15.5;
let g = false;
